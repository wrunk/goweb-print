# Simple HTTP Server To Print Request and Response

To keep my sanity, I will use echo webserver

The point of this is to verify a mandrill domain without needed a damn email system!!

So we hijack their incoming email system (still must have access to domain's DNS) and send
their own email address verification to themselves. Blog post coming soon.
